A database is an organized collection of structured information, typically stored in the form of tables (rows & columns). Relational databases allow storing and retrieving different kinds of related information e.g. products, customers, and orders for an online shopping site. Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced ""sequel"") is the most widely used language for interacting with relational databases, and is an essential skill for Data Science professionals.

It dives more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. You will learn how to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.

This course will teach you how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. It is designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x (the original CS50 course) itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!

In order to integrate React with a .NET Web API component we utilise the 'ASP.NET Core with React.js' project template from within the free version of Visual Studio 2022 (the community edition).

The App that we build enables users to rank items by dragging and dropping the items (displayed in a list) to a cell position on the ranking grid (the grid is positioned above the list of relevant items). Each cell position on the grid denotes a ranking value for e.g. the top left cell is position number 1, denoting the top ranked item, the cell positioned to the immediate right of this cell denotes the 2nd ranked item and so on...the bottom right cell denotes the worst possible ranking position. So this is a fun app to code that will give a learner an insight into how to build a simple app using React on the front-end that leverages a .NET Web API component on the backend.

This project was inspired by the classic carnival/arcade style shooting gallery games! Learn to build the entire project from scratch using Python and the PyGame framework. We start by setting up PyGame, and drawing static images on the screen. Then we animate tiers of procedurally drawn enemies onto each level and get them moving, then check to see if the player has shot them. Once the player clears a full level of enemies, they proceed to the next level. Then we create pause functionality, a main menu and game over conditions.

We store the high scores in an external text file that we read in from when the game boots up and write to it any time there is a new high score during gameplay.

ARM is becoming an increasingly popular language in the world of computer programming. It is estimated that over 200 billion devices contain an ARM chip, making the ARM language valuable to understand. By understanding an assembly language, programmers can have a better understanding of how code is compiled and run, making it possible to create more efficient programs. In addition to this, programmers can work at a lower level, allowing them to write code that interacts with hardware in an efficient manner.

We'll use the ConstraintLayout for the layout and two event listeners for the app logic. After you enter a base amount and a tip percentage, the app will calculate the tip and total for you. We also implement a tip percentage animation and a footer to make our app more unique.

We’ll break down recursion with all sorts of data-structures, animations, debugging and call-stack analysis to get a deeper understanding to these principles.

The code is written in Java, but the principles are agnostic to any language.

We'll start off by keeping things simple with a single container, and gradually add more complexity to our app by integrating a Mongo container, and then finally adding in a redis database for authentication. 

We'll learn how to do things manually with the cli, then move on to docker compose. We'll focus on the challenges of moving from a development environment to a production environment. 

We'll deploy and Ubuntu VM as our production server, and utilize a container orchestrator like docker swarm to handle rolling updates.

Make your website come to life with interactive animated logos or headers, or just practice fundamental JavaScript coding techniques with me on these fun examples. In this tutorial we will go from basics to advanced and create multiple different pixel effects with vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas.

The tutorial starts with a simple beginner friendly project, where we analyze image for pixel data and use it to color shift the image and turn it into grayscale. Then we use that basic knowledge in a powerful way to create many different advanced animations with vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas, completely from scratch.

This course was created by Professor Immanuel Trummer, PhD. He is an assistant professor for computer science at Cornell University.
🐦 Follow Professor Trummer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ImmanuelTrummer

🎥 Watch part 2 of this course here (8 more hours): https://youtu.be/lxEdaElkQhQ

You will learn how to query database systems via languages such as SQL (the structured query language). Then, you will see how database systems work internally, how they store and index data, how they process and optimize queries, and how they process transactions while providing guarantees such as isolation, atomicity, and durability (ACID guarantees).

The course addresses questions of database design and discusses novel approaches to data management via NoSQL or NewSQL systems. Finally, the course will discuss about graph, stream, and spatial data, and about systems that are specialized for those data types. The lectures are from the Fall 2020 online lecture at Cornell by Prof. Trummer (www.itrummer.org).

This course was created to make deep learning accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite for this course is that you know how to code (a year of experience is enough), preferably in Python, and that you have at least followed a high school math course.

This course was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. Jeremy has been using and teaching machine learning for around 30 years. He is the former president of Kaggle, the world's largest machine learning community. Sylvain Gugger is a researcher who has written 10 math textbooks.

NB: Chapter 2 contains widgets, which unfortunately are not supported by Colab. Also, in some places we use a file upload button, which is also not supported by Colab. For those sections, either skip them, or use a different platform such as Gradient (Colab is the only platform which doesn't support widgets).

508,7PLx6hwRUnA,2020-05-01T17:12:09Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,May 2020 Summit - freeCodeCamp.org,"It's been a while since the freeCodeCamp community has held a big Summit live stream. Now with the coronavirus pandemic, we need social interaction more than ever.

Our community has been hard at work on a number of major improvements to the freeCodeCamp curriculum. We've been publishing a ton of free courses on YouTube. And we have other new tools we're excited to demo, too.

Here's what we'll cover during this one-hour stream.

* The 4 new Python-focused certifications *

In late 2019, we started work on 4 new Python certifications. These are all part of freeCodeCamp's core curriculum, and will immediately follow our existing 6 web development certifications (which will initially remain unchanged).

Beau will demo these new certifications and explain how we're rolling them out.

We will also give a big update on how we're rolling out Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. As I said in December, we are moving to 100% project-oriented learning. These new practice projects will be 100% optional, and none of this will affect people who are already going through freeCodeCamp's curriculum and earning certifications.

We are excited to demo these new certifications, which we'll open to beta testers in May.

* Big improvements to the YouTube channel *

As you may have heard, the freeCodeCamp community's YouTube channel is growing.

I'll talk about our commitment to keeping the channel ad-free. I'll also show how we're focusing on YouTube membership as a way to sustain our nonprofit. And some new freeCodeCamp swag you can buy to support the community: shirts, caps, even mugs.

And good news: we're going to be live-streaming a lot more.

* Demoing the new Contributor Site *

We have a new area of freeCodeCamp dedicated to helping contributors get started with code contributions, adding subtitles to videos, answering questions from the community, and more.

Mrugesh will demo the site and a lot of its key functionality.

Mrugesh will also talk about some of the exciting things he's doing to keep freeCodeCamp running fast under the growing server death-hug of people around the world learning to code.

We are moving the freeCodeCamp Guide over to our publication
Abbey will talk about the process of transitioning all of the articles from the freeCodeCamp Guide over to our publication.

This means all of our guide articles will have better accessibility, with large text and a clean single-column layout.

We will also have JSON Schema, AMP versions of articles, and a lot of other features to make it fast and accessible.

Abbey will also give us an update on the state of freeCodeCamp's publication – which is now getting more readership than many major newspapers.

Finally, she'll demo our navigation search bar tool, which now averages nearly 1 million searches per week.

* Updates on the community forum and chat rooms *

I will talk about freeCodeCamp's online community – spread across our forum, chat rooms, the r/freeCodeCamp subreddit and the freeCodeCamp Earth Facebook group.

These online communities have become increasingly important in an age of national lockdowns and social distancing measures.

Nothing beats hanging out with other developers in person. But since this isn't possible currently, we are making sure everyone has access to the next-best thing – online developer communities.

* Then we will answer any questions you all may have. *

Here's the full agenda:

10.00 Quincy talks about YouTube: merchandise, YouTube membership, superchat, and more frequent streams
10.05 Quincy talks about growth of community: the forum, chat rooms, subreddit, and more
10.10 Mrugesh demos the Contributor site
10.15 Mrugesh talks about efforts to improve performance at scale
10.20 Abbey talks about the Guide-to-News transition
10.25 Abbey shares a few big recent articles, and talks about our editorial philosophy
10.30 Beau demos the new Python curriculum and talks about the instructional design work we're doing

NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

In this tutorial you will go from having zero knowledge to writing an artificial intelligence that can compose Shakespearean prose.

No prior experience with deep learning is required, though it is always helpful to have more background information. We’ll use a combination of embedding layers, recurrent neural networks, and fully connected layers to perform the classification. 


⭐️Course Contents ⭐️
⌨️ (01:16) Getting Started with Word Embeddings 
⌨️ (33:25) How to Perform Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews 
⌨️ (59:32) Let’s Write An AI That Writes Shakespeare 


⭐️Course Description ⭐️
The basic idea behind natural language processing is that we start out with words, i.e. strings of characters, that are almost impossible for the computer to meaningfully parse. We can transform these strings into a vector in a higher dimensional space. Different words will be represented as vectors of different lengths and directions in this space, and this allows us to find relationships between words by finding the component of one vector along another. Don’t worry, the TensorFlow library handles all of this, we just have to have some basic idea of how it works.

Since this is a type of supervised learning, we also have labels for our text. This allows the AI to compare the relationships between words to the training labels, and learn which sequences of words represent good and bad movie reviews. This would also work for finding toxic comments, fake product reviews… just about anything for which we need a multiclass classification of text – provided we have enough training data and labels.

The last step in complexity is to change the final layer that handles the classification. This allows us to actually output text that the AI thinks is meaningful. What’s really special about this is that the neural network starts out not even knowing that letters are a thing, or that we use spaces and punctuation, to producing something that approximates human level writing.

We're going to be creating a small application in React that calls the Hacker News API. We'll be looking at React memo, Axios (to make API calls), styled components, and finally we will test our work using React Testing Library.

Once we have done all this we will run our application through Lighthouse (a browser extension) that allows us to test for accessibility, performance and so much more. We will be making 500+ automated API calls in this application, and I want to show you how to use memo with React so that we can avoid making multiple network calls if we already have the data.

In addition to the latter technologies, we will be styling the application using SCSS (CSS) and following the BEM naming methodology.

We'll make sure that the application is fully responsive. You will see how to use Lighthouse (Chrome extension) to make sure your website is fully accessible by getting all accessibility features integrated into our application.

This process can be applied to any deep learning paper, not just deep reinforcement learning.

In the second part, you will learn how to code a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent using Python and PyTorch, to beat the continuous lunar lander environment (a classic machine learning problem).

DDPG combines the best of Deep Q Learning and Actor Critic Methods into an algorithm that can solve environments with continuous action spaces. We will have an actor network that learns the (deterministic) policy, coupled with a critic network to learn the action-value functions. We will make use of a replay buffer to maximize sample efficiency, as well as target networks to assist in algorithm convergence and stability.

February 15, 2022 Update: note that we cannot update this video. Here are some updates from @FrankJacquette:
- Firebase no longer offers a free tier. You will have to set up an account and provide a credit card to use Firebase functions.
- The current version of Busboy has broken the API described in the video. I recommend modifying your code to use the current version.
- React-router-dom has API-breaking changes since the video was made. I recommend downgrading to version 5.x.
- The instructor will occasionally introduce a bug in his work and repair it later. If your code isn't working, watch a little longer before assuming it's your issue.
- The Redux code as implemented will cause an infinite page refresh loop under some circumstances.  Clearing local storage and reloading the page will bypass this.
- componentWillReceiveProps is deprecated and should be replaced with componentDidUpdate. There are several good pages out there describing how to do this.
- Material UI has gone through a major version release since the video was produced.  While everything in the video will continue to work, the documentation you'll find is for the current version of MUI and will be slightly different. Also, Grid has slightly different parameters.

In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics.

The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch.

The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning.

Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge. These are studied in some of the more traditional environments from the OpenAI gym, like the cart pole problem.

Dropbox is a content and collaboration platform trusted by more than 500 million users and 300,000 teams. It also has an API which allows you to add Dropbox features to your apps, such as file storage, sharing, previews, and search.

One example of such an app is an expense organizer, which can help businesses prevent their receipts from turning into chaos. Each employee simply adds their receipts to a Dropbox folder, and then the app takes care of organizing them.

In this course, you'll build this organizer app while learning the fundamentals of working with the Dropbox APIs. It will all be done in plain JavaScript. Along the way you'll also learn several ES6 concepts, like array methods and async/await functions.

To learn more about the Dropbox API, visit the docs: https://www.dropbox.com/developers

669,jAAmI5gMlVo,2019-01-10T19:16:48Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Async/Await - JavaScript Tutorial,"This is an in-depth look at the Async/Await feature in JavaScript.

Code: https://github.com/eXtremeXR/Async-Await

First, we're going to go through brief history of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and see how it transitioned from callbacks to promises to generators and to finally Async/Await.

Then we're going to focus purely on Async/Await and we'll go through a bunch of examples.

We'll start off by learning how we can do sequential flow using Async/Await and we'll also see how we need to be careful about error handling.

Next, we'll move onto parallel execution. We'll see how we can use Promise.all() function to be able to execute multiple promises in parallel. Again, we'll see why we need to be careful about our error handling.

Last but not least, we'll take a look at how we can do iterations with Async/Await. We'll start off with for loop, then move onto forEach, for of loop is going to be next and finally we'll wrap that section with while loop.

At the end, we'll do a quick recap of the things we just went through.

Yet, in a bit of a paradox, servers are less essential to our work than they've ever been. We can now do things on the front-end that used to require a back end. When we do need a back end, our front-end skills can be put to work, giving us some surprisingly powerful new abilities. Join Chris on a whirlwind tour of the tools, tech, and code that puts more power than ever into our front-end hands.

This talk will take a brief look at historic codes and ciphers before taking a look at modern day Cryptography. If you want to be able to know the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher or get a glimpse into the mathematics behind public key Cryptography this talk is for you.

Talk given by Chris Riley at PHP UK Conference 2018.

In this talk by Beau Carnes, you will learn the theory of neural networks. Instead of teaching about a framework such as Karas or TensorFlow, Beau gives an overview of the methods behind those frameworks.

First, he explaining the key concepts of deep learning.  Then, he live codes a neural network using Python without using any frameworks. This will help you understand the concepts at a deeper level.

We will learn how to deploy and run models along with full deep learning applications in the browser! To implement this cool capability, we’ll be using TensorFlow.js (TFJS), TensorFlow’s JavaScript library.

By the end of this video tutorial, you will have built and deployed a web application that runs a neural network in the browser to classify images! To get there, we'll learn about client-server deep learning architectures, converting Keras models to TFJS models, serving models with Node.js, tensor operations, and more!

Its evolved from a simple two week hack into a vibrant ecosystem that is continuously evolving to the modern web.

Join Matt as he walks the timeline of JavaScripts evolution from where it began into what it has become today. If you are new to web development or just getting back into development or coming to web development from a different part of the stack this is for you. Matt will showcase several demo apps that highlight the differences in how web apps used to be built with ES5 and highlight the tools that have changed how they are built for the modern web and ES6. Finally he will show how that same app can be built with Angular, one of the many modern frameworks that helps engineers build responsive and performant web applications.

Talk given by Matt Hippely at the JavaScriptLA meetup.

Thanks to JavaScriptLA for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!

Building a web Application Programming Interface (API) traditionally involves a significant amount of work: defining routes, writing functions to fetch and shape data, ensuring a consistent interface, documenting the API, and more.

GraphQL, an open source alternative framework for fetching data over HTTP, seeks to reduce much of the overhead of building more traditional web APIs. All data from a web service is provided at a single endpoint, and consumers can discover data schemas to then build and run queries to get only the data they need. The result is faster and more efficient development experience in many aspects of building and consuming the data layer.

A lot of new devs wonder what web developers do on a day-to-day basis. In this video, you will learn all about the Daily Stand Up meeting, which is common in many development jobs. You will also learn tips to help you through your first DSU.

They increasingly often talk with each other. In order not to get crazy in this communication mess, it’s good to take a look at many aspects of creating web API. We will answer the ""why"", ""what"" and ""how"" questions to begin with. We will meet the three wizards: Morville, Fielding and Richardson. We will play with resources, behavior, relations, parameters, headers, collections, versioning, errors, security, throttling, cache, HATEOAS, management performance, health and business. There will be a bunch of tips on how to make consumers of our API happy. Warning: may contain traces of snakes and camels.

Talk by Paweł Zajączkowski.

793,5GYr1L0wMxg,2018-09-14T15:00:00Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Deep Learning for Developers,"Deep Learning has become the hottest topic in the IT industry: a week hardly goes by without a new breakthrough. In this talk, we’ll give you a tour of the state of the art: through code-level demos based on Open Source libraries like Apache MXNet or Keras, we’ll demonstrate advanced models based on CNN, GAN and LSTM architectures, which solve complex problems such as image detection, image generation and machine translation. 

We’ll also show how to customize models on your own data set and how to use them in your own applications. Last but not least, you’ll learn how to deploy these models in production with just a few lines of code thanks to Amazon SageMaker.

Talk by Julien Simon at Devoxx Poland 2018.

Thanks to Devoxx for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!

freeCodeCamp.org contributor David Jolliffe created a quiz game with questions on JavaScript, CSS, networking, and computer science.

If you have an Amazon Echo nearby, you can play the game right now by saying: ""Alexa, start the free code camp quiz.""

The entire project, along with it's ~100 questions, is open source and on GitHub: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCampTriviaQuiz

We would welcome additional questions. Open a pull request adding your new question to the codebase, or just open a GitHub issue with the question if you're in a hurry.

Today with evergreen browsers and modern JavaScript, we no longer need this crutch. Let’s look at our favorite jQuery techniques like $.ajax() and $(…).click() and $(…).addClass() and compare this to the code we’d write in modern JavaScript. Sprinkled in are great ES6 techniques like rest and spread, promises and fetch. Challenge yourself on your next project to see if you can run in a post-jQuery world.

NOTE: You still might want to learn jQuery because many companies still use it. If you want to learn jQuery, check out this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkyK9woUZUtunToLtNGoQHB

A little discipline can help if you want your site to load and be interactive as soon as possible on mobile.

830,n7y0y_8zTo4,2018-08-23T14:13:18Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,SVG Filters Crash Course,"When it comes to graphical effects on the Web, CSS has already come a long way in the last few years, with the introduction of CSS filters and blend modes a few years back. However, when compared to effects available in graphics editors such as Photoshop and the likes, CSS is still behind, by far. But SVG, on the other hand, is not that far behind.

SVG comes with a set of filter primitives that enable you to recreate Photoshop-grade effects in the browser, using a few lines of code. While the syntax and attributes of these filters may seem intimidating and not very friendly at first, once you get a grasp of how they work, you’ll have a very powerful tool in your arsenal, that allows you to push the boundaries of what is possible on the Web.

In this talk, Sara is going to give you a crash course on SVG filters — why they are awesome, how they work, and examples of powerful effects you can create with them, in an friendly, easy-to-follow approach. Brace yourself, and get ready to set your imagination free and expand your creativity for what’s possible on the Web today.

After a few years working as a Front-end dev, I looked at a list of ""JS interview"" questions and realized that I couldn't answer many of them (at least not well). So I set out on a long, somewhat lonesome journey of JS discovery, and am pleased to share my findings with you, in the form of a talk.

Regardless of how you feel about getting asked random questions meant to trick you up in an interview (you should be appalled), my talk will cover some basic JS subtleties, and hopefully fill in some knowledge gaps w/r/t:
- Hoisting and variable scope
- Expressions v. statements
- Undeclared v. undefined v. null
- Equality comparisons
- How to properly walk out if an interviewer asks you to do fizz buzz

This talk was given at Nodevember 2016 by Russell Anderson.

854,3LWgbjVWLug,2018-08-01T15:35:13Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,WebAssembly and the Death of JavaScript,"For more than 20 years JavaScript has been the only 'native' language of the web. That's all changed with the release of WebAssembly. This talk will look at what WebAssembly is, why it matters and crucially what it means for JavaScript and the future of web development. JavaScript brought interactivity to the web more than 20 years ago, and despite numerous challengers, it is still the only language supported by browser. However, as those 20 years have passed we've moved from adding a little interactivity to largely static sites, to creating complex JavaScript-heavy single page applications. Throughout this journey, the way we use JavaScript itself has also changed. Gone are the days of writing simple code snippets that are run directly in the browser. Nowadays we transpile, minify, tree-shake and more, treating the JavaScript virtual machine as a compilation target.

The problem is, JavaScript isn't a very good compilation target, because it simply wasn't designed to be one.

Born out of asm.js, a somewhat crazy concept dreamt up by Mozilla, WebAssembly was designed from the ground-up as an efficient compilation target for the web. It promises smaller payloads, rapid parsing and validation and consistent performance ... and it's ready to use, right now!

This talk will look at what's wrong with the way we are using JavaScript today and why we need WebAssembly. It will delve into the internals, giving a quick tour of the WebAssembly instruction set, memory and security model, before moving on to the more practical aspects of using it with Rust, C++ and JavaScript. Finally we'll do some crystal-ball gazing and see what the future of this rapidly evolving technology might hold.

I will present some helpful tips about self-motivation, time-management, stop procrastination, setting priorities, staying organized, believing in yourself and keeping a balance between your career and personal life. I'm going to present my personal examples of coding/studying every single day for the past 1,5 years, what I gained and how I achieved my goals. We are going to explore ways of finding mentors, friends and expanding your social network. This talk is not only about getting better at your 9 to 5 job but also about developing yourself.

On the other hand, DeepLearning is one of the hottest topics discussed around. Why so much attention? What are these technology, frameworks and how one can make use if them?

In the talk, we start with base concepts of machine learning, explaining tensors and advantages of Tensorflow, shifting more into the direction of practical examples of how one can apply mentioned technologies without going too deep into mathematics.

We cover high-level API like Keras. How to utilize knowledge and computing resources of such huge companies like Google and Facebook with a technique called Transfer Learning. And finally bringing a few examples how such systems might be deployed to production systems with Kubernetes and Tensorflow Serving.

871,R0jVqeYzs9c,2018-07-17T15:38:32Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Functional Programming in Scala,"After 10 years of Object Orientated Java, 2 years of Functional Programming in Scala was enough to convince me that I could never switch back. But why? The answer is simple: Functional Scala lets you think less. It reduces the number of moving parts you need to hold in your head, lets you stay focussed and saves your mental stack from overflowing.

In this talk I'll show you how to stop treating Scala as a better Java and start exploring the world of Functional Programming. I'll use code examples to demonstrate a four step path that'll let you ease yourself into the world of Functional Programming while continuing to deliver production quality code.

With each step we'll learn a new technique, and understand how it leaves you with less to think about: Hopefully this talk will convince you that Functional Scala leads to code that's easier to hold in your head, and leave you excited about learning a new paradigm.

892,BJDVRA1KgdQ,2018-07-04T15:18:54Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,The human nature of failure & resiliency,"Projects fail in droves. Systems hiccup and hours of downtime follows. Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.

We talk a lot about building resilient systems, but all systems are (at least for now) built by humans. Humans who have been making the same types of mistakes for thousands of years. 

Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.

This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems.

By the end of this talk the audience will have an awareness of the most common psychological reasons for mistakes and failures and how to develop systems and processes to protect against them.

This is especially true for those who choose the self-taught track, and are responsible for everything from selecting the best learning materials to carving out time to study (often while working a full-time job). Is there any way to stop the insanity already?  

In this video, I’m going to show you five secret weapons for learning web development. I didn’t pick up these tools all at once, but once I had them arsenal my learning speed and knowledge retention shot through the roof!

It compiles to JavaScript, has great performance, no runtime exceptions, and can be embeded easily into existing JS projects without the need for huge rewrites or time investment.
We'll be taking a practically focused crash course tour of Elm, ideally you'll walk away being able to put Elm into production either from scratch or in an existing project.

💻Code: https://github.com/Khaledgarbaya/gatsby-contentful-site

What is Gatsbyjs?

Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers—ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.

What is Contentful?

Contentful provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

In this talk, you'll learn about the technical means we used to achieve this goal, and the processes and policies that facilitate and encourage code reuse throughout @walmartlabs.

It's a very handy tool for the working programmer, but it's often shrouded in off-putting mathematics.

In this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.

You can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.

Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work.

It has tremendous power to liberate productivity, increase innovation and reduce overhead.  However, adopting serverless technologies is still not well understood.  As the ecosystem grows around serverless, we’re empowered with options, yet further distanced us from a clear path to adoption.

In this talk, we’ll break through the clutter to investigate use-cases, adoption methods, the power of serverless now and it’s capacity to meet the demands of the future.  We’ll also look into open-source, community-led projects within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that aim to advance the adoption of serverless technologies, while enabling interoperability and an open ecosystem.

You start from a tab in your browser and you finish with an icon on your home page… with no installation!

During this session, we will see what are services worker and the 10 Commandments of a Progressive Web App. The debate between web and native is not ready to stop!

Why? Because while regular bits are limited to only two boring values, QBITs can take near infinite values and operate singularly or in harmony with each other. This outstanding property gives rise to a new kind of algorithms (and a lot of fun!). Follow me on a journey from Zuses Z3 computer and Schrödingers cat to supercooled quantum processors and parallel universes - no PhD in physics required.

For any system to survive it must figure out how to bring in new members. In this keynote, you'll hear from Keila Banks who since 11 years old (now 15) has been speaking at conferences around the world; and her father Phillip Banks, who's been programming since he was 10 and provided the same path for his children. Along with 3 other sons, they have all been a part of technology efforts and open source communities since their youth. Hear from a teen how you can help grow open source communities and youth involvement from what we've learned along the way.

I'm Zaydek, and I've built a few websites. In the process, however, I've found myself overwhelmed with the syntax and baggage of HTML and CSS. In this course, I provide a brief introduction to HTML and CSS (hopefully!) without the pain I had to first endure.

I’ll teach you learn how to start from scratch and architect something that would then be meaningful for you and others.

Are you interested in seeing how Kubernetes stands up to the record-breaking viewership and a login rate that is beyond belief on Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere? Come and see things we have done for the Game of Thrones preparation. We will talk about how we provision Kubernetes clusters on AWS, and how we monitor them and microservices that are running on the clusters.

In this talk, we will also go over how HBO Go went from deploying and running microservices on virtual machines in AWS EC2 to running the very same services inside the Kubernetes clusters. We were able to dramatically increase the productivity of our engineering teams and efficiency of resource utilization in the process. It wasn’t always a smooth ride and it wasn’t a one shot deal. Instead, it was a long and at times challenging journey starting from operating a reliable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, advancing to gradually deploying select services into Kubernetes clusters, load testing them, and running them in parallel to our current EC2 installations, and finally going live. Come and learn some helpful tips and mistakes we made along the way, which could help your organization embrace the Kubernetes world.

Talk given by Zihao Yu & Illya Chekrygin at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2017 conference.

By now, a lot of developers are aware of their practical uses, such as small and accessible icons, or illustrations. In this session, though, Sarah will go beyond typical use cases. She’ll cover a few practical things like styling SVG icons like typography, and then dive into the creative wilds of this graphic format built with math. She’ll make it respond to physics, make it bounce and snap, stack it like legos for responsive, and make it interactive with front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React. In this session Sarah will push the boundaries of what’s possible while also thinking about cross-browser stability, and you’ll come out of it with a whole new world of tools in your front-end developer toolbox.

Sarah Drasner is an award-winning speaker, consultant, and staff writer at CSS-Tricks. She is also the co-founder of Web Animation Workshops, with Val Head and the author of SVG Animations from O’Reilly. Sarah is formerly Manager of UX Design & Engineering at Trulia (Zillow). She won CSS Dev Conf’s “Best of the Best Award” as well as “Best Code Wrangler” from CSS Design Awards.

1115,fsTzLgra5dQ,2017-10-09T00:15:24Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,How to make money as a freelance developer - business tips from an expert,"0:00 – Should you become a freelance developer?
8:22 – How to stand out from other freelance developers
14:53 – How to sell your services
25:50 – Where to sell your services

Summary of points:

Should you be a freelancer? 
- Are you self-motivated or do you need structure provided for you?
- People who can regulate themselves, and require themselves to work set hours from home, are best suited for freelancing.
- People who require someone to provide them with a work schedule and deadlines is better suited to work for someone.
- Can you make money as a freelancer?
- Roughly 30 percent of the 24 million small businesses in the US do not have a website. This equates to 7.2 million businesses.
- If each of these businesses paid $3,000 for a website then that would be a total market of $21,600,000 (7.2m * $3,000).

How you can stand out from other freelancers. 
- It’s important to recognize that most developers don’t do a good job of connecting with potential customers.
- There are a plenty of web developers in the US. Despite this, 7.2 million small businesses don’t have a website. 
- The fact that there is a high number of developers and a high number of businesses still in need of service indicates a “disconnect” between the development community and the small business community.
- The best way to bridge the “disconnect” is to identify and solve the problems of small businesses.
- Developers must talk to small businesses about their problems and how software will solve those problems.
- Many developers make the mistake of talking about software and code and not about problem solving.
- Taking a “problem solver” approach will help bridge the disconnect between developers and small businesses.

How to sell your services.
- The initial meeting/phone call is your opportunity to connect with the customer.
- Use your initial meeting with a potential customer to identify the customer’s needs and problems.
- Identifying the potential customer’s problems requires in-depth questions and follow up.
- Close the sale by explaining how software will solve the problems you have identified.
- Give specifics as to functions the software will perform and how those functions will solve the problems you have identified. This is more effective than the approach of many other developers
- Your written proposal must be specific as to the services you are providing. This avoids disputes.

Where to sell your services
- Networking events can help generate business.
- DO NOT go to networking events which are mostly made up of developers. It’s better if you’re the only developer in the room.
- BNI (https://www.bni.com/) is a good place to network with small business owners.
- Third party services can help you find customers
- Thumbtack.com and Fiverr.com are good places to find customers.
- Third party services/platforms often include fees for listing your services and you will often perform work for reduced rates.
- Your own website can bring in business.
- This doesn’t require the time of networking and alleviates the problems of third-party services/platforms
- Google Adwords is a way to promote your website. Adwords, however can be expensive.

It defines the conditions that must be met for a potentially shippable product to be considered “done as in done.” It’s how we know that we “did the thing right”, meaning that we built in the correct level of quality into the product. These are different from the acceptance criteria, which are written by the product owner and help us know that we did the “right thing.”

I have been teaching myself to code for almost a year now. I initially started from Freecodecamp.com and other tutorials, the more I learn about web technologies like javascript the more I want to learn lower level languages like c++. A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development. I have read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school. I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't received one response regarding an interview.
I would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies ie react, angular...

I am really keen on getting some React JS experience but anywhere I apply to, they seek an experienced React engineer. I have learn React on my own and recruiters do not seem to appreciate it. Further, at this stage at the big companies, I reach 1-2 rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for the role. Recently I got a rejection from the [COMPANY X] and [COMPANY Y . These both required 5-6 years of industry experience. My application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential - only to find I was not as good as somebody they were looking for.
Next week I am appearing for a full stack role at [COMPANY Z] but it is clearly out of my league - they are seeking at least 6 years experience in JavaScript. I am pursuing it for interview experience + what if it works out somehow?
I do not know many people who can refer me. How do I get my first React job [without any industry experience]?

UPDATE: Toward the end of the video, I run the command: sudo pm2 startup systemd. This was a mistake. Run it without the sudo and follow the instructions given in the output. If you did follow my video instructions, just use: sudo pm2 unstartup systemd. This will undo everything and you can type the command correctly.

1381,1FfX2xW3104,2016-11-05T15:51:13Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Maths for Programmers: Introduction (What Is Discrete Mathematics?),"Transcript:

In this video,  I will be explaining what Discrete Mathematics is, and why it's important for the field of Computer Science and Programming. Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or finite sets of elements rather than continuous or infinite sets of elements. Imagine trying to run a program that requires an infinite number of executions to complete a task. It's obvious to say, that the program would run forever and the task would never be completed because there is an infinite number of executions. In order to avoid this problem, we approximate the continuous sets with discrete sets. Now you may be thinking, I never use math that involves infinite sets, but I promise that you do. The simplest example is with a circle. A circle by definition is an infinite number of points equally distant from a fixed point. The problem with this is that if we try to write a program that prints out all of these points, it will run forever because there is an infinite number of points and therefore an infinite number of executions. So, this is physically impossible, that's why if we zoom in here, you can see that when you come down here, there is all these points, but in reality we should have even more points between these points. And if we zoom in on those, we should have more points between those points, and we can never complete the task. Now we've all seen circles on computers, how is this possible, because we just established that it's impossible. The answer is, is that there is approximations. For example, consider regular polygons. Regular Polygons, like a triangle, or a square, or a pentagon. They don't really look like circles. However, if you keep increasing the number of vertices. Eventually you will get hexagons, octagons, decagons, hexadecagons, icosagons. You can see that these regular polygons, the more and more you increase the number of vertices, which the vertices are equally distant from a fixed point, they will eventually approximate a circle, and eventually they will be indistinguishable to the naked eye and will look identical to a circle.

1382,LSBC3n9x52Q,2016-11-04T12:53:49Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Maths for Programmers: Introduction (Tips For Learning),"Transcript:

Hello World, Shawn Grooms here with Free Code Camp. And in this video I will be giving you three tips on how to learn Discrete Mathematics. The first tip is to stay calm. People often hear the word Mathematics and panic. When you panic, you stop listening. If you stop listening, you can't learn the material. If you simply stay calm, then you'll be able to learn the material better. You aren't being graded on the subject so there's no need to panic. The second is to rewind. You can rewind the videos at any time. When I learned Discrete Mathematics I didn't have this opportunity. In theory you should be able to learn the material much faster than I was ever able to. I strongly encourage rewinding the video. Finally, explain. Once you think you understand the material of the videos you can try to explain the material out loud either to yourself or to a friend. If no one is around, or you feel weird talking to yourself then you can try and explain it to a rubber ducky. There's a concept in Programming called Rubber Ducky debugging, which is where programmers go through their code, line by line, trying to identify bugs in their code by explaining it to a rubber ducky. So similarly, if you go through the material of the videos, subject by subject, you will soon be able to identify any gaps in your understanding of the material.

Thank you for joining me on this short hike about web design vs web
development. 

The web design is the how. The web development is the what.

Today we're going to discuss how they work together to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet.

The web designer, what they do will impact the 'How' the UI and UX looks and feels.

The web developer, what they do will impact 'What' the UX and UI will do once you start to click on buttons. 

An example is the login process.

A designer will decide where the login process will start on the page.

A developer will decide what that process will entail. Are you logging in with your email address, username or social media account?

Another example is building a car. A designer will choose what color the car is. Is it red, white, or blue? Cloth or leather seats? Tinted windows?

A developer will decide if it's a V6 or V8 engine. Is it a gasoline, hybrid
or all electric vehicle?

Together, they work to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet. 

Again, a web designer is the how and the web developer is the what.

1407,o0Pi0966BOM,2016-03-27T18:27:02Z,UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ,Computer Basics: What does 'Open Source' mean?,"Hello campers, I'm Anthony also known as dapperAuteur on Free Code Camp and GitHub.

Thank you for joining me on this short hike about Open Source code.

I'm going to explain open source code by comparing it to its opposite, closed source code.

There are a variety of models in between the two. Open source code is published, shared, public, and supported by the community. Closed source code is not published, not shared, not public, and it is not supported by a community.

What makes open source code so important to us is the fact that it is supported by the community. Anything that is created with open source code is done by those who use it.

An example of open source code would be Linux software. It's opposite would be Windows or Apple's OSX operating systems. Linux was created and is available for free and it is supported by the community. 

However, all open source code isn't free. Some are, most are. But, the major difference between open source code and all other types of code is the fact that it's, the code is available for you to use and then improve upon. 

An example would be a recipe. You can find recipes online. You buy the same products in stores and not have access to the recipes. 

One example is Coca-Cola. You get Coca-Cola in a variety of flavors. If you want a new flavor of Coca-Cola, you must wait for the organization that owns the recipe to make that new flavor. You can ask for it, but there's no guarantee you'll get it. 

With a recipe you can find for your own cola online, you can make changes to it. Make your own cola, your own cherry, your own vanilla, your own chocolate cola and then you can share that with the rest of the community and that will be an open source recipe, an open source product.

Again, open source public, published, shared.  Open source software is supported by and improved upon by the community.

Let's cover computer security. The first thing we're going to talk about is something called a dictionary attack which has to do with your passwords. When creating your passwords, some sites require extremely specific and complicated passwords, which is actually a bit unnecessary. The type of attacks they're trying to gaurd you from are dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks are programmed to try every word in the dictionary, or in its own database of common words and passwords, as the password for a large mass of usernames. If your password is Kangaroo, they're probably going to break into your account. Most passwords aren't this simple, but that doesn't matter. They attack such a massive amount of accounts that they only need a few passwords that are relatively simple. When creating a password, you want to use different cases, numbers, and symbols, but one of the most effective ways to create a good password is to throw some random letters in there (ex: kangarooSyCA67). Also, stay away from sequential numbers. Phishing, another thing to watch out for, is emails or webpages that mimic other valid sites to try and trick people into entering their personal information, though the site truly isn't connected to the site it's trying to mimic. In general, two ways to safeguard from these attacks are checking the address in the browser and to open a new browser and go to the website that is claiming to contact you. Let's also discuss encryption and HTTPS. If you are at Starbucks trying to access your bank account, you have reason to be suspicious that someone could see and take your information. You will want to look for a green HTTPS instead of HTTP at the beginning of the web address. That means that the site you're sending your information to is encrypting your passwords and other information, scrambling up data according to a code that only they know. In general, whenever you're showing private or sensitive information, check for HTTPS. A few other general tips: don't share passwords between important accounts. If a site you use gets hacked into, your password may be compromised regardless of its strength. Also, don't download strange files. If you don't recognise the file type like .pdf, .txt, .jpg, be wary. Some of these files you download can be very powerful and even run your computer from the inside. Lastly, keep your software updated, particularly software that interacts with the internet. One way that information can be compromised is when 'bad guys' find holes and gaps in security of older versions of softwares.

The Internet, part 1: IP Addresses.
  Every device has an IP address.
  IP addresses are assigned based on location, and are vital for the internet to work.
  We're going to talk about the Internet: Part 1, How the Internet Works.
  To know how the internet works, we're going to talk first about IP addresses.
  You may be familliar with the fact that each of your devices has its own IP address, just like a house or an apartment has its own address.
  The internet can't deliver data to a device unless it has an IP address.
  Not only does your device have one, but so does the modem, the router, and every step along the way, which we'll get to later.
  IP addresses are determined based on location, starting with 5 big international regions.
  Moving from left to right, the numbers mean something specific about your location.
  This number isn't specific enough that you could call 911, give them your IP address, and have them know where you live.
  However, it is specific enough that you could google \Where's the best ice cream near me\ and google could give you information close to your location.
  This is done using your IP address.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Software,IP Address (API),Programming Language (Software Genre),Technology,Computer (Industry)",73,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,26297,279,0,4,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

The goal of a CDN is to establish higher quality network connections.

CDNs accomplish this by providing effective routes between their own servers that can fast-track users to their destination, or if its faster and/or cheaper, another copy of that website destination that is being hosted on another server. 

This concept and type of service is not new, but is becoming more popular as the internet grows. 

Websites contract and pay a CDN service, who in turn pays an internet provider to use their servers for their data.

An example of CDNs are Google's Hosted Libraries. -- https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery

Google hosts these libraries so that your users can load them into your own site much more quickly than if you host them yourself. 

There's a chance the user's browser is even storing a cached version from visiting a previous page, making the process even quicker. If you aren't familliar with the term 'cache', don't worry, we'll cover that in future videos.

As a user, you probably use CDNs all the time without realizing it. 

As a developer, you may want to use CDNs like google libraries to help your page load more quickly.

As a company, a CDN would be useful if you want your product or site to reach users more efficiently in the larger scheme of their network and the internet as a whole.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,,"JavaScript,Web Development Tools (Organization Sector),Free Code Camp,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,Code,Learn to Code,non-profits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Data,Technology,Web Development,Javascript,Content Delivery Network",134,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,23097,276,0,5,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

The DOM is the browser's internal, progrematic representation of a webpage. Languages like javascript allow you to modify the DOM, and thus the website without editing the HTML of the page.

Technically, the DOM is an API (application programming interface). There are many types of APIs, but this particular API interacts with XML and HTML documents. It's in charge of how those documents are accessed and manipulated. 

Really, you can do a lot with the dom, and if you're already scripting in JS and jQuery, you're already doing it. 

You can insert new things, elements, or alter style or content for elements that already exist. 

This can be done with pure javascript, like: 
document.getElementById(id)
element.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.createElement(name)

You can also use libraries like jQuery to simplify, standardize and automate manipulating the DOM, like:

Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations (elementary operation = an operation that takes a fixed amount of time to preform) performed in the algorithm.

Time complexity is classified by the nature of the function T(n). O represents the function, and (n) represents the number of elements to be acted on. 

Worst-case time complexity, the longest it could possibly take with any valid input, is the most common way to express time complexity. When you discuss Big-O notation, that is generally referring to the worst case scenario. For example, if we have to search two lists for common entries, we will calculate as if both entries would be at the very end of each list, just to be safe that we don't underestimate how long it could take.

O(1) - determining if a number is odd or even. O(1) is a static amount of time, the same no matter how much information is there or how many users there are.

O(log N) - finding a word in the dictionary (using binary search). Binary search is an example of a type of ""divide and conquor"" algorithm. 

O(N) - reading a book

O(N log N) - sorting a deck of playing cards (using merge sort)

O(N^2) - checking if you have everything on your shopping list in your cart

O(infinity) - tossing a coin until it lands on heads

As a rule of thumb, anything with N^2 or any other exponent is NOT a good algorithm for a site with multiple users. If your algorithm slows down exponentially with the input, you're going to want to look for a more efficient way to solve that problem.

Whenever you’re coding loops within loops, you want to be especially mindful of time complexity.

http://bigocheatsheet.com/
Big O Cheat Sheet is the place to look once you can classify your algorithm, like as a ""merge-sort"" or a ""quick-sort"".

Maybe you've been told that links to style sheets (CSS) should be included in the header and that links to script (JS) should be included in the footer. Ever asked yourself why?

If you've ever seen a webpage that loads the text first, then after a bit loads the formatting and style, you've seen a page that didn't have the links to style and script in the correct places.

This all has to do with how the browser decides it's loaded enough information to display. There's an event called 'DOMContentLoaded', and once that event happens, whatever is loaded will be displayed.

The DOM will tell the browser it's ready once the HTML is loaded, and sometimes the CSS and JS hasn't caught up. However, if you place the CSS in the header and the JS in the footer, you can ensure that all content will be loaded before the DOM triggers the 'DOMContentLoaded' event, the event that shows the user your content.

Time complexity is a way of discussing how long specific algorithms take. This is useful in streamlining software so it works as fast as possible.

When you're writing code, you should be aware of how long it's going to take to execute. Nobody wants to create a product that users find frustrating due to slow use. 

Time complexity is talked about in relation to an algorithm, a collection of one or more functions.

Big O Notation specifically helps you identify when an algorithm wouldn't 'scale' well, or work well with varying amounts of users, information, or other inputs.

This does NOT correspond with Moore's law - no matter how big and fast your computer is, if the algorithm is exponentially inefficient, it's realistically unusable.

Additionally, questions about Big O Notation and time complexity can be used as interview questions. Your employers will want to know that the code you write will not take too long to load on the page for the users, and knowledge of Big O Notation shows that you're cognizant of that while writing your code.

The take-away from this video is that Big O Notation helps you identify where there could be problems (sometimes BIG problems) in speed and memory when your site or app grows.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,,"JavaScript,Web Development Tools (Organization Sector),Free Code Camp,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,Code,Learn to Code,non-profits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Data,Technology,Web Development,Javascript,Algorithms",156,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,35786,393,0,16,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

The 'Sources' tab is most useful for debugging JavaScript. The bigger your project is, the harder it can be to find exactly where a problem occurs. 

You can select different parts of the code to be 'breakpoints', checkpoints that will stop the code at that exact moment.

There are different breakpoints you can watch for, like for a specific line of code, on a DOM event, a server request called XMLHTTP request, or a javascript event. 

When you set a breakpoint, the browser pauses everything when it interprets that line of code or event. 

By slowing everything down and giving yourself a chance to examine what's happening at every spot you've set, you can keep track of exactly what's happening in the page or app. 

Once all of the breakpoints are set, you can step through the code and examine the state of your page or app at every breakpoint.

The network tab helps answer questions like ""Which element or part of the page took the longest?"" or ""What initiated a request?"". 

The network panel records detailed information about how long each element of your page or app takes to load.

Every request is recorded in the log, which can be found lower in the network panel. 

If you look at the line on the side, you'll notice a pattern of colors. Those colors each represent a different type of content in the request. 

The longer the line is a certain color, the longer that type of content took in that request. Ultimately, you want short lines, and if any request has long lines, you know what may be slowing down the web page.

When you're working with numbers, you should also be aware that JS has an interesting attribute called ""floating-point format"".

Examples include '.split(' ')', which will turn a string into an array and can do so in many different ways. Methods are powerful - many times when you want your script to do something, there's a method for that. 

Functions, like variables, are something you define and create. During your bonfires, you will create functions that take a certain piece of information and manipulate it in whatever way you choose.

If you want to store more than one piece of information to a variable, you can do so by creating an array or an object. 

**Disclaimer: Objects in JS are not exactly the same as objects in other languages. We will discuss objects here as they pertain to JS.

Arrays are sets of data between [square, brackets]. Data is separated by commas. That data can be in the form of a boolean, string, number, or even another array. We call that a nested array. 

Objects are a type of data that can look or behave similar to an array in the way that it's more data stored in one variable in an organized way. You'll hear it referred to as JSON, and when you make API calls to other sites (getting information to display on your own page) it will frequently be returned in JSON. 

An example of object notation is: 
var obj = {
""name""    :   ""Briana"",
""food""       :   ""cheese"",
""dog"" :   ""Maurice""
};

Notice the curly brackets, the 'keys' with values like name or food,, and the value called a 'property' that is tied to the 'key', like Briana or cheese.

   In this video, we go into a little more detail about routers and packets, important concepts to understand about how the internet works.
  Let's talk more about routers and how they relate to networking.
  Routers are the things that connect different small area networks.
  I want to give a metaphor for this: I'm a teacher and I work at a school.
  Say I have a package that I need to get to someone who works in the district offices.
  I don't know where she is, I don't know where her office is located, but I know her name.
  I go to my secretary, like my first router, and I say \Hey, I need to get this to so-and-so at the district office, can you please help me?\ and she'll say \Sure, I don't know exactly where her office is either, but I know the next step, I can get it to the district\.
  So she goes on and sends it to the secretary at the district office, the next router.
  That secretary has no idea who I am or where I am, but she sees the name on the package and knows the end location.
  What I'm trying to get across here is that each router only has to know its own little network, the stops right next to it.
  It doesn't have to know the whole internet, but just its own connections.
  It can take information and say, alright, I don't know exactly where that's going, but I'll pass it along in the right direction.
  That's really all it takes.
  Routers can be different sizes, different capacities, but what they do is know their own neighborhood, take the information, and pass it in the right direction.
  Another thing we'll get into a little later is that the routers don't even have to have the full package of information.
  If one comptuer is trying to send information to another, the data might get split up between different routers and that's okay.
  The computers still know how to put the information back together correctly.
  The little pieces of information that are sent are called packets.
  Packets are actually little pieces of binary code (drawn on board).
  This is an example of what packets might look like, a visual representation of the electrical current that the computer can translate into 1's and 0's, which we all know is binary that can represent literally any digital data.
  These little packets are sent across through routers, and if a file is too large for one packet, it can be broken up into frames (smaller little packets).

  We discuss what constitutes a chip and why technology gets cheaper every year.
  In this video we are going to be talking about chips and something called Moore's Law.
  You've probably noticed over the last 10 or so years, if you're going to go buy an MP3 player, you can get a lot more storage for a lot lower price.
  You probably have even done the thing where you're at the store and you think, \Well, I can get one now, or I could wait 6 months and see how far the price has dropped\ which might sound ridiculous but this is actually a trend that's been happening for a long time.
  Let's talk about what makes a chip.
  A chip is full of these little things called transistors, which are switches that can either be a 1 or a 0 (noticing a theme here?).
  All of these transistors fit onto a chip, and that's how it stores information.
  What makes these chips larger/faster is the amount of transistors on a single chip.
  Moore's Law is the observation that the amount of transistors fit on each chip has doubled every two years since 1965.
  This is important because it's making technology more affordable and accessible.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Software,Technology,Computer Science (Field Of Study),Data,Moore's Law (Quotation Subject),System,Management",70,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,23318,,0,14,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

  How computers turn analog sound into digital files, and the pros and cons of data compression.
  Let's discuss analog vs digital on a very basic level.
  Most specifically, we'll talk about how computers interpret analog sound and turn it into a digital file.
  An analog sound wave could look like anything, but for this example it's a wavy line.
  The computer takes it and measures at lots of different points, turning them into numbers.
  This is called sampling.
  Later, the computer can take those numbers and turn them into sound again.
  Let's also discuss data compression.
  The benefit of compression is that it's a smaller file: it's easier to store, it's easier to send to someone else, and it just takes up less space.
  One of the ways this is done in sound is that the sampling is taken less often.
  Another way is that it takes the measurement from a median point instead of from 0, so the numbers recorded are smaller.
  In images, it's done by measuring groups of pixels by 16 instead of individually.
  The takeaway from this video is that you'll want to use digital files as they're a higher quality, and when you're looking at compression, you want to decide how far you are willing to go to ensure the user still has the best possible experience.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Computer File,Data Compression (File Format Genre),Software,News,Technology,System",99,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,22026,,0,3,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

Star us on GitHub: https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://stark-lowlands-3680.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps.

As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am ""your commit message"". Note that you should replace ""your commit message"" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.

You can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku.

Here are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump:

User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

Bonus User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

Hint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.

   In this video we discuss what source code is, interpreters and compilers, and what open source means.
  Let's talk about source code: what source code is, where you'll see it, and how the computer makes sense of it.
  Source code itself is the actual text document that the programmer creates: they type it up, it's letters, numbers, and symbols.
  If you give that to somebody and have them look at that document on their computer, that's not going to help them view their email, it's not going to be a browser, it's just a text document.
  The computer has to have a way of interpreting that and making something really powerful run from it.
  There are two main ways this is done: either by an interpreter or a compiler.
  Every browser has an interpreter, and that's how javascript is processed.
  Other languages, like C++, are used with a compiler.
  Unlike an interpreter, the compiler does all of its work on the programmer's end.
  They send out their package, their product, and it's already been compiled, it can already run on a machine.
  Javascript, however, and other interpreter languages, you just write the javascript and the browser on the user's end has the capability to interpret it so you don't need a compiler.
  Everyone has an opinion to which is better (interpreter or compiler), but really each has their pros and cons, and it goes on a case by case basis.
  They're better at different things.
  Now, let's focus on what open source means.
  Free Code Camp is open source, meaning that all of the documentation and source code is open and accessable.
  You may be thinking, \so what?\ but what's awesome is that if you want to change or improve Free Code Camp, you can write that improvement and maybe get it implemented.
  It's a great way for websites and software to grow in a strong and fast way because of the community working together to improve it.
  One unwritten rule of contributing to open source projects is that you should generally submit your improvements to also be open source, and by giving that improvement back to the public, you let others use your improvement as well.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Source Code (Quotation Subject),Computer Science (Field Of Study),Software,Technology,Data,System,Security,Business,Computer Security (Software Genre),Training",150,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,53253,,0,26,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

  Variables are used frequently in Javascript and many other coding languages.
  In this video, we're going to talk about variables in code.
  Variables, just like in Algebra, are when you have a letter or a word and it represents something else.
  Here we're doing var x = \Briana\. When we reference \x\ later on, it's going to know that's Briana.
  When we console.log(x), it's going to output \Briana\.
  But be careful - if we put console.log(\x\), with the x in quotation marks, it will output the letter \x\.

  We discuss what (and where) the console is, why it's useful, and show a little of how it works.
  The console: what it is, where you can find it, and what you use it for.
  The console is very commonly used to display system adminstrative messages.
  Your browser and your computer both have their own consoles.
  Once you become famlliar with it, you will find it to be a very useful and powerful tool.
  In Javascript, the console is used as a great tool for debugging and finding out where in your code there's a problem.
  One of the most important terms you'll need to remember is \console.log()\.
  The process of doing this can be put anywhere in the lines of code to help find, identify, and ultimately fix specific issues.
  Using the Chrome browser and the Chrome console, if we type in \console.log(\Free Code Camp rocks!\);\ the console will literally display \Free Code Camp rocks!\.
  This will also work with numbers and booleans, which are true/false statements.

  Everything is done sequentially, just straight down, so refrencing something that is below and hasn't happened yet will lead to a problem.

   This is a brief and basic overview of how the internet works.
  For a more in-depth explanation, check out web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm
  Let's talk a little more about how the internet works.
  We've already estabilished that every device and router on the intenet has its own IP address, which is assigned based on location.
  Using these IP addresses, your device can talk to your modem, then to a router, which is set up by a web service.
  The router would go to the domain name server, still just sending a request.
  That server would send back the information that was requested, and it would go back to your device.
  You might think this is fallable; if one step goes out, then the whole process is done.
  But really, there are so many routers and so many routes that if even a big chunk goes out, that still won't really affect the functionality.
  It's really amazing.
  What I want you take away from this video is that your device, since it has an IP address, can send out a request for informatoin, and that information will get back to your device via servers and routers that comprise the internet.
  Now, this explaination is really quite basic.

   This video covers the basics of local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks.
  In this video we talk about Data Networks.
  You've heard of networks, like a water network, road network, cell phone network, or television network.
  Today we'll talk about data networks, which are the networks that computers use.
  The three types we'll cover are the Local Area Network (LAN), the Wide Area Network (WAN), and the Virtual Private Network (VPN).
  A LAN is just a small group of computers that are connected together.
  The most important thing about a LAN is that those computers are close together.
  So, if you're using wifi at Starbucks or at your school, you're probably using a LAN that you can only connect to if you are physically close to it.
  A WAN (Wide Area Network) is two or more LANs that are connected over long distances.
  So, maybe a school in Colorado wants to connect to a school in Missouri.
  They could use a WAN.
  You might think that these are connected over the internet, and in the case of a VPN (Virtual Private Network, which is basically the same conceptionally as a WAN), you're right.

   A little more detail on what constitutes a motherboard and what functionalities are standard in PCs.
  Today we're going to be talking more about the motherboard.
  We mentioned it briefly in previous videos, but we'll give some more detail today.
  What makes a motherboard is the connection between the CPU and the memory - if it doesn't do that, it's not a motherboard.
  But, most motherboards do a lot more than that.
  Primarily, they have expansion slots and ports.
  Expansion slots are where you put anything that can increase the performance of a computer without putting more load on the CPU.
  For example, a graphics or a sound card would up the user experience by giving better sound or video quality, but it wouldn't slow down the computer.
  A Network Interface Card could also go in an expansion slot.
  This would help your computer conncet with the networks around it, something we'll talk about more in upcoming videos.
  PC and Express cards are primarily found in laptops, and Express cards are taking over due to their smaller size.
  In addition to expansion slots, motherboards have ports.
  On your computer, you probably know there's a place to connect USB, firewire, SD card, ethernet, even an audio plug-in to listen through headphones.
  These are all considered ports, a place on the motherboard where you can connect the CPU to some outside source to either get or give information.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Computer (Industry),Laptop (Product Category),Motherboard,Technology,Software,Data,System",111,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,28100,,0,6,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

  This video covers the basics of supercomputers, servers, workstations, PCs, and microcontrollers.
  Let's discuss the different types of computers.
  The biggest type is called a super computer, a computer with lots of CPUS that work on the same problem at the same time using a technique called parallel processing.
  The next type is called a server.
  A server holds and accesses lots of data or programs.
  Free Code Camp is hosted on a server which stores all of that information.
  Let's talk now about a workstation computer - a computer that may look similar to a personal computer, but has a lot more power and is a lot pricier.
  Toy Story was built on workstation computers.
  Now, personal computers are by far the most common.
  Maybe you've heard \I'm a Mac!\ or \I'm a PC!\ something indicating they're different, but really my own personal MacBook is still a PC, a personal compter.
  It's both a Mac and a PC.
  The last type of computer we'll talk about is a microcontroller, the type of computer you might have in your car that is really good at a small specialized task, but wouldn't be used the same way a PC would be.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Technology (Industry),Software,Computer (Industry),Data,System",91,2d,hd,true,True,rectangular,36850,,0,9,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

   Binary does more than express numbers - through bytes, it can symbolize all alphanumeric symbols, which can then be interpreted into more complex code.
  Let's talk about the most basic level that computer can understand other languages, like javascript.
  THe most basic thing is a bit, up or down, 1 or 0.
  After that ther'es a Byte, 8 bits.
  All numbers (255 and less), letters, and symbols can be translated into Bytes that the computer can understand.
  So, all of the numbers, letters, and symbols in your javascript can be translated.

   Data speed and data size are measured differently.
  In this video, we cover how data speed is measured.
  Let's talk about data speed.
  Data speed, unlike data size, is usually measured in bits per second, whereas size is usually measured in Bits.
  Once we start talking exponentially, that makes a really big difference.
  How we talk about speed really depends on what we're talking about.
  In audio download, we talk about kilobits per second.
  In internet, we use megabits per second.
  In network speed, we talk about Gigabits per second (one billion bits per second!).
  The main takeaway here is that speed is usually measured in bits and size is measured in Bytes.
  Additionally, if you have an internet speed that says however many bits per second, keep in mind they are talking about something 8 times less than Bytes, how you are thinking about data.",freeCodeCamp.org,27,none,,en,"Free Code Camp,JavaScript,Pair Programming,Node.js,AngularJS,MongoDB,SQL,code,learn to code,hour of code,nonprofits,full stack,coding bootcamp,software engineer,open source,Computer (Industry),Data (Website Category),Technology,Software",90,2d,hd,true,True,rectangular,37657,,0,10,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0       GizsSo-EevA

   How the size/amount of data is measured, starting from a bit and going all the way up to a petabyte.
  Today we're going to be talking about Data Size.
  The smallest size we can have is called a bit.
  That bit can only be a 1 or a 0, and that goes back go binary we've been talking about.
  After that, we've got a Nibble, which is 4 bits, which isn't common but it's adorable.
  The Byte, which is very common, is 8 bits.
  A lot of things are expressed in binary Bytes.
  After we get past the tiny bit and the small Byte, we get bigger really fast.
  The next step up is a Kilobyte, 1024 Bytes, or 1,048,576 bits.
  After that there's Megabyte, or 1024 Bytes to the power of two.
  Then it's Gigabyte, 1024 Bytes to the power of three; Terabyte, 1024 Bytes to the power of 4, and Petabyte, 1024 to the power of 5.

   In this video, we decode a number written in binary notation.
  Let's talk about the binary numeral system, also known as a bunch of 1's and 0's over and over again.
  We're going to start by labeling, staring backwards, how many numbers there are.
  (In this video there are 7, but we start at 0, so we only get up to 6.) Pretty straightforward.
  The next step is to take 2 to the power of whatever place it is, a 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1, all the way up to the largest placeholder.
  Then, all we have to do is fill in some mathamatical blanks by completing the exponential 2 problems.
  If there is a 1, we keep that number (the two to the exponent solution) and add it to other \1\ or \on\ numbers.
  If it's a 0, we disregard it.

  What binary looks like, and what it can mean.
  0's and 1's can turn be interpreted into far more complex data.
  Today we're going to talk a little bit about binary code.
  Binary code is a really simple computer language where there are only 1's and 0's, that are either on or off, 1 being on and 0 being off.
  Those 1's and 0's can be pretty much anything, but generally they are just numbers, letters, and symbols.
  We're going to go into how you decode a number in binary, but as you can probably guess, translating binary can be done with a quick google search.

   In this video we cover the basic functions of a motherboard, expansion slots, and power supply.
  Let's quickly review - the 4 basic parts of a computer are the input, like the mouse or the keyboard, the output, which is seen on the monitor or heard on the speakers, the CPU, the central processing unit, and the memory.
  Now memory can be short term memory, called RAM, or longer term memory.
  That's usually as a hard drive, but it can also be a CD-ROM or a flash drive, anything like that.
  In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today: the motherboard, expansion cards, and power supply.
  The motherboard is what connects everything.
  While the data's flying around over here trying to figure out where to go, the motherboard helps route it so it goes to the right place.
  Expansion cards are sound cards, video cards, that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user.
  Power supply is, as it sounds, what gets power to the computer.
  It's usually that part that has a fan on it to keep it from overheating.

   At the very least, a machine needs these four basic parts to be considered a computer.
  Today we're going to talk about the basics of computer hardware.
  Computers are made up of 4 basic parts: the input, output, CPU, and memory.
  The input is what you're putting into the computer.
  Think about mouse, keyboard, microphone, any way you're getting data into the computer.
  The output is what you're watching on your monitor or listening to on your speakers.
  These can both be any format like text, numbers, videos, images, what have you, it doesn't matter.
  CPU stands for central processing unit, and that's what we all think of when we think of a computer.
  It's what does the functions, it's what runs the software, it manipulates the data.
  The memory is where we store data and information.
  Now, the CPU has exclusive access to this memory.
  You can't get to the memory from the input or the output without the use of the CPU.
